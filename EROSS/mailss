why autoscaling failed earlier
what new approach you are going to apply for auto scaling
what extra service you are going to use in this senario and what will be the cost for that



hello team, 

As last time we configure Autoscalling we facing the website slow down issue after applying it on prod,
the reason for that is, we configured NFS on prod server for autoscalling purpose which slow down the other servers which are created from Autoscalling.
	
so for that we have another solution, that we can use the AWS provided service "EFS" for the file sharing task which going to use further in Autoscalling. 

also for now we are going to use the "Default efs configuration that is General Purpose memory And Throughput will be Bursting" to test acordingly for prod environment. 
if the default configuration will not work as per expected result, we need to improve our troughput IOPS ( read write capacity) and it will Cost accordilgly. 

the cost for that is as per mbps that is for 10 mbps it will cost $72/month.
find the costing details below.
