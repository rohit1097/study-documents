log monitoring kibana

insfrastucture mo. - prometheous for fetching 

kibana for showing and visualization



Promitheus :
- work as Collection agent
- metric monitoring solution, which collects data from Endpoints
- uses promQL query language.
- Loki tool can be use with grafana for log monitoring.
- when data is get stores inside premotheous local storage, we can Visualize & creates Dashboart it using Grafana.
Features :
	- Multidimentional Data Maodel
	- PromQl
	- Service discovery ( discovers service & collects data )
	- time series collection via pull model 
	- No relience on distributed model. ( data store on Local Storage not on distributed storage )
	- Alert Manager 
Prometheous server has three parts of working Process :
Retrival Part :
	- Pulls metric data	
Storage Part :
	- Stores metric Data
HTTP Server Part :
	- Accept Queries		
		- Prometheous web GUI
		- Alert Manager
Prometheous metrics & its types:
	- Counters:
		- records a value that only goes up
		- Query how fast the value is increasing
	- Gauges:
		- records a value that only goes up and down
		- Do not have to query its rate
			
	- Histogram:  
		- Take many measuremenet of a value, to later calculate averages or percentiles.
		- You know what the range of values will be up front, so you define your own.


NODE-EXPORTER :
	- USE TO COLLECT DATA FROM MULTIPLE SERVERS/NODES, to prometheos server
	- can be connect with prometheous server by exported-config.yaml file
	- need to add ip of that server in this file.
	



Grafana :
- visualization agent
- real time continuous monitoring.
- creates Dynamic dashboards
- Explore metrics & Logs ( promethoes, Logs )
- Loki tool can use with grafana for log monitaring.





Nagios is a fast monitoring tool, which involved both log and infra monitoring. 

but on prometheous we can configure infrastructure monitoring only, for log monitoring we have to add other log monitoring exporter, also need to configure grafana-loki with prometheous.
also the visualization is quite good at prometheous-grafana.

Both the tools are mostly used as monitoring tool.
