ECS ( Elastic Container Service )


# Applications:

- Deploy Containers without infra management
- containerize everything
- highly secure
- performance at scale
- designed for use with oyher aws service
- integrate with all aws sevice


# how it works :

- Build container images 
	- create/build/push cont. images to repo.	
- Define application 
	- selects comt images, resources for our application
- launch containers
	- ECS launches cont for our application
- manage containers
	- ECS scales our app, & manage our cont for availability
	
	
esc service deployment type :

	- rolling update : ECS service scheduler replaces the currently running tasks with new tasks(replace with healthy instances). bases on minimum Healthy Percent and maximum Percent.
	- blue-green deployment : blue= live, green=idle, same environments are there, replace env with new env, 
	   (by sending some traffic to new env if works well then completely moved to new) 
	
	
## PROCESS OF DEPLOYING DOCKER CONTAINER OVER ECS ::

1> OVER AWS ECS MANSGEMENT CONSOLE

2> Set up your first run with amazon ECS :
	- here, u will launch a wizard using amazon ecs

3> Task Defination :
	- Define's the size of container ( cpu/memory size )
	- number of container
	 
4> Configure the Amazone ECS Service :
	- load balancers
	- port numbers
	- ip adress
	- name of cont
	- name of the service	  	
	- desired numbers of tasks

5> Configuration Of Cluster :
	- Puting Security in this step
	
6> Result: 
	- launch instance & run service
	- bunch of containers rumnning in that instance
